# Her

Her is an ORM (Object Relational Mapper) that maps REST resources to Ruby objects. It is designed to build applications that are powered by a RESTful API instead of a database.

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/remiprev/her.png)](http://travis-ci.org/remiprev/her)

## Installation

In your Gemfile, add:

```ruby
gem "her"
```

That’s it!

## Usage

First, you have to define which API your models will be bound to. For example, with Rails, you would create a new `config/initializers/her.rb` file with these lines:

```ruby
# config/initializers/her.rb
Her::API.setup :base_uri => "https://api.example.com" do |builder|
  builder.use Faraday::Request::UrlEncoded
  builder.use Her::Middleware::DefaultParseJSON
  builder.use Faraday::Adapter::NetHttp
end
```

And then to add the ORM behavior to a class, you just have to include `Her::Model` in it:

```ruby
class User
  include Her::Model
end
```

After that, using Her is very similar to many ActiveModel-like ORMs:

```ruby
User.all
# GET https://api.example.com/users and return an array of User objects

User.find(1)
# GET https://api.example.com/users/1 and return a User object

@user = User.create(:fullname => "Tobias Fünke")
# POST "https://api.example.com/users" with the data and return a User object

@user = User.new(:fullname => "Tobias Fünke")
@user.occupation = "actor"
@user.save
# POST https://api.example.com/users with the data and return a User object

@user = User.find(1)
@user.fullname = "Lindsay Fünke"
@user.save
# PUT https://api.example.com/users/1 with the data and return+update the User object
```

## Middleware

Since Her relies on [Faraday](https://github.com/technoweenie/faraday) to send HTTP requests, you can add additional middleware to handle requests and responses. Using the block in the `setup` call, you have access to Faraday’s `builder` object and are able to customize the middleware stack used on each request and response.

### Authentication

Her doesn’t support any kind of authentication. However, it’s very easy to implement one with a request middleware. Using the builder block, we add it to the default list of middleware.

```ruby
class MyAuthentication < Faraday::Middleware
  def initialize(app, options={})
    @options = options
  end

  def call(env)
    env[:request_headers]["X-API-Token"] = @options[:token] if @options.include?(:token)
    @app.call(env)
  end
end

Her::API.setup :base_uri => "https://api.example.com" do |builder|
  # This token could be stored in the client session
  builder.use MyAuthentication, :token => "bb2b2dd75413d32c1ac421d39e95b978d1819ff611f68fc2fdd5c8b9c7331192"

  builder.use Faraday::Request::UrlEncoded
  builder.use Her::Middleware::DefaultParseJSON
  builder.use Faraday::Adapter::NetHttp
end
```

Now, each HTTP request made by Her will have the `X-API-Token` header.

### Parsing JSON data

By default, Her handles JSON data. It expects the resource/collection data to be returned at the first level.

```javascript
// The response of GET /users/1
{ "id" : 1, "name" : "Tobias Fünke" }

// The response of GET /users
[{ "id" : 1, "name" : "Tobias Fünke" }]
```

However, you can define your own parsing method, using a response middleware. The middleware is expected to set `env[:body]` to a hash with three keys: `data`, `errors` and `metadata`. The following code enables parsing JSON data and treating the result as first-level properties. Using the builder block, we then replace the default parser with our custom parser.

```ruby
class MyCustomParser < Faraday::Response::Middleware
  def on_complete(env)
    json = MultiJson.load(env[:body], :symbolize_keys => true)
    env[:body] = {
      :data => json[:result],
      :errors => json[:errors],
      :metadata => json[:metadata]
    }
  end
end

Her::API.setup :base_uri => "https://api.example.com" do |builder|
  builder.use Faraday::Request::UrlEncoded
  builder.use MyCustomParser
  builder.use Faraday::Adapter::NetHttp
end
# User.find(1) will now expect "https://api.example.com/users/1" to return something like '{ "result" => { "id": 1, "name": "Tobias Fünke" }, "errors" => [] }'
```

### OAuth

Using the `faraday_middleware` and `simple_oauth` gems, it’s fairly easy to use OAuth authentication with Her.

In your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "her"
gem "faraday_middleware"
gem "simple_oauth"
```

In your Ruby code:

```ruby
# Create an application on `https://dev.twitter.com/apps` to set these values
TWITTER_CREDENTIALS = {
  :consumer_key => "",
  :consumer_secret => "",
  :token => "",
  :token_secret => ""
}

Her::API.setup :base_uri => "https://api.twitter.com/1/" do |builder|
  builder.use FaradayMiddleware::OAuth, TWITTER_CREDENTIALS
  builder.use Faraday::Request::UrlEncoded
  builder.use Her::Middleware::DefaultParseJSON
  builder.use Faraday::Adapter::NetHttp
end

class Tweet
  include Her::Model
end

@tweets = Tweet.get("/statuses/home_timeline.json")
```

### Caching

Again, using the `faraday_middleware` makes it very easy to cache requests and responses:

In your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "her"
gem "faraday_middleware"
```

In your Ruby code:

```ruby
class MyCache
  def initialize
    @cache = {}
  end

  def write(key, value)
    @cache[key] = value
  end

  def read(key)
    @cache[key]
  end

  def fetch(key, &block)
    return value = read(key) if value.nil?
    write key, yield
  end
end

# A cache system must respond to `#write`, `#read` and `#fetch`.
# We should be probably using something like Memcached here, not a global object
$cache = MyCache.new

Her::API.setup :base_uri => "https://api.example.com" do |builder|
  builder.use Faraday::Request::UrlEncoded
  builder.use FaradayMiddleware::Caching, $cache
  builder.use Her::Middleware::DefaultParseJSON
  builder.use Faraday::Adapter::NetHttp
end

class User
  include Her::Model
end

@user = User.find(1)
# GET /users/1

@user = User.find(1)
# This request will be fetched from the cache
```

## Relationships

You can define `has_many`, `has_one` and `belongs_to` relationships in your models. The relationship data is handled in two different ways. If there’s relationship data when parsing a resource, it will be used to create new Ruby objects.

If no relationship data was included when parsing a resource, calling a method with the same name as the relationship will fetch the data (providing there’s an HTTP request available for it in the API).

For example, with this setup:

```ruby
class User
  include Her::Model
  has_many :comments
  has_one :role
  belongs_to :organization
end

class Comment
  include Her::Model
end

class Role
  include Her::Model
end

class Organization
  include Her::Model
end
```

If there’s relationship data in the resource, no extra HTTP request is made when calling the `#comments` method and an array of resources is returned:

```ruby
@user = User.find(1) # { :data => { :id => 1, :name => "George Michael Bluth", :comments => [{ :id => 1, :text => "Foo" }, { :id => 2, :text => "Bar" }], :role => { :id => 1, :name => "Admin" }, :organization => { :id => 2, :name => "Bluth Company" } }}
@user.comments # => [#<Comment id=1>, #<Comment id=2>] fetched directly from @user
@user.role # => #<Role id=1> fetched directly from @user
@user.organization # => #<Organization id=2> fetched directly from @user
```

If there’s no relationship data in the resource, an extra HTTP request (to `GET /users/1/comments`) is made when calling the `#comments` method:

```ruby
@user = User.find(1) # { :data => { :id => 1, :name => "George Michael Bluth" }}
@user.comments # => [#<Comment id=1>, #<Comment id=2>] fetched from /users/1/comments
```

For `has_one` relationships, an extra HTTP request (to `GET /users/1/role`) is made when calling the `#role` method:

```ruby
@user = User.find(1) # { :data => { :id => 1, :name => "George Michael Bluth" }}
@user.role # => #<Role id=1> fetched from /users/1/role
```

For `belongs_to` relationships, an extra HTTP request (to `GET /organizations/2`) is made when calling the `#organization` method:

```ruby
@user = User.find(1) # { :data => { :id => 1, :name => "George Michael Bluth", :organization_id => 2 }}
@user.organization # => #<Organization id=2> fetched from /organizations/2
```

However, subsequent calls to `#comments`, `#role` and `#organization` will not trigger extra HTTP requests as the data has already been fetched.

## Hooks

You can add *before* and *after* hooks to your models that are triggered on specific actions (`save`, `update`, `create`, `destroy`):

```ruby
class User
  include Her::Model
  before_save :set_internal_id

  def set_internal_id
    self.internal_id = 42 # Will be passed in the HTTP request
  end
end

@user = User.create(:fullname => "Tobias Fünke")
# POST /users&fullname=Tobias+Fünke&internal_id=42
```

## Custom requests

You can easily define custom requests for your models using `custom_get`, `custom_post`, etc.

```ruby
class User
  include Her::Model
  custom_get :popular, :unpopular
  custom_post :from_default
end

User.popular # => [#<User id=1>, #<User id=2>]
# GET /users/popular

User.unpopular # => [#<User id=3>, #<User id=4>]
# GET /users/unpopular

User.from_default(:name => "Maeby Fünke") # => #<User id=5>
# POST /users/from_default?name=Maeby+Fünke
```

You can also use `get`, `post`, `put` or `delete` (which maps the returned data to either a collection or a resource).

```ruby
class User
  include Her::Model
end

User.get(:popular) # => [#<User id=1>, #<User id=2>]
# GET /users/popular

User.get(:single_best) # => #<User id=1>
# GET /users/single_best
```

Also, `get_collection` (which maps the returned data to a collection of resources), `get_resource` (which maps the returned data to a single resource) or `get_raw` (which yields the parsed data return from the HTTP request) can also be used. Other HTTP methods are supported (`post_raw`, `put_resource`, etc.).

```ruby
class User
  include Her::Model

  def self.popular
    get_collection(:popular)
  end

  def self.total
    get_raw(:stats) do |parsed_data|
      parsed_data[:data][:total_users]
    end
  end
end

User.popular # => [#<User id=1>, #<User id=2>]
User.total # => 42
```

You can also use full request paths (with strings instead of symbols).

```ruby
class User
  include Her::Model
end

User.get("/users/popular") # => [#<User id=1>, #<User id=2>]
# GET /users/popular
```

## Custom paths

You can define custom HTTP paths for your models:

```ruby
class User
  include Her::Model
  collection_path "/hello_users/:id"
end

@user = User.find(1)
# GET /hello_users/1
```

You can also include custom variables in your paths:

```ruby
class User
  include Her::Model
  collection_path "/organizations/:organization_id/users"
end

@user = User.find(1, :_organization_id => 2)
# GET /organizations/2/users/1

@user = User.all(:_organization_id => 2)
# GET /organizations/2/users

@user = User.new(:fullname => "Tobias Fünke", :organization_id => 2)
@user.save
# POST /organizations/2/users
```

## Multiple APIs

It is possible to use different APIs for different models. Instead of calling `Her::API.setup`, you can create instances of `Her::API`:

```ruby
# config/initializers/her.rb
$my_api = Her::API.new
$my_api.setup :base_uri => "https://my_api.example.com" do |builder|
  builder.use Faraday::Request::UrlEncoded
  builder.use Her::Middleware::DefaultParseJSON
  builder.use Faraday::Adapter::NetHttp
end

$other_api = Her::API.new
$other_api.setup :base_uri => "https://other_api.example.com" do |builder|
  builder.use Faraday::Request::UrlEncoded
  builder.use Her::Middleware::DefaultParseJSON
  builder.use Faraday::Adapter::NetHttp
end
```

You can then define which API a model will use:

```ruby
class User
  include Her::Model
  uses_api $my_api
end

class Category
  include Her::Model
  uses_api $other_api
end

User.all
# GET https://my_api.example.com/users

Category.all
# GET https://other_api.example.com/categories
```
